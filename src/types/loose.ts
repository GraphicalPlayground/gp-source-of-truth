/**
 * @brief Loose Auto-completion type for string literals.
 * @details This type allows for auto-completion of string literals while still allowing any string value to be assigned.
 * It is useful for scenarios where you want to provide a set of known values for auto-completion, but also allow for flexibility in accepting other string values.
